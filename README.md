I am a Mathematics Researcher/Instructor studying tensor decompositions associated to invariants from geometry and Lie-theory. I am working on applying these decompositions to clustering and visualizing large-scale data.

    -  Thesis: _A TIZ-Correspondance Adjusted for Symmetry_
- B.A. in Mathematics from University of Colorado Boulder.
    - Thesis: _Count-Free Weisfeiler--Leman and Group Isomorphism_
